## FAQs

### When do we depart from Stuttgart Hbf?
tbd

### How will the weather be?

### What shoes could be good?
Shoes above the ankle might be helpful and give enough stability since we might have some path-like ways on the hike.
Plus they should be warm enough, since there might be some snow-parts we might walk through.

### What clothes would be best?
Some comfortable clothes which are water-resistant (not necessarily waterproof).
Pants probably not too warm necessary, since we will walk and will have some sun, so super warm minus-degree proof pants are not necessary.

For the upper body could be nice to have 3 Layers = T-Shirt + middle-layer like a pullover or sweatshirt + a medium-warm jacket, same as for pants, we'll be walking and it might get warmer while walking.

It could be helpful to bring a replacement T-Shirt if we sweat and the other one needs to dry a bit, there ll be toilets where we could change on the hut.

Something for the head could be good to cover the ears at least and some gloves for the hands.

### What about fooood?
Depends on your habits, though a good early breakfast could make sense and then bringing a sandwich for the hike, some snacks, an apple or something similar for in between, then we could have some food on the hut, before the return.

In case better have some more with us, than later needing it. Ann baked a cake (not gluten-free), we'll bring it tomorrow, as well.

Have min. 1 liter water bottle with you, even better would be an insulated 1l bottle with tea.
